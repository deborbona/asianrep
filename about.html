    <h3 class="sectionHeaderAbout"> Asians are often times overlooked when it comes to big Hollywood pictures. When they are casted in movies, their characters are usually stereotypes of Asians made in poor taste. This is important because Asian representation in the media can affect the way Asians are treated in Western countries. When people with little experience of what life is like in the East see movies that show such stereotypes, their only thought-of examples surrounding Asian cultures will be derived from those scenes. On the other hand, where there is a lack of Asians being represented in the media, they may be disencouraged from participating in jobs in these fields. This website has been created to bring attention to this issue, but also to give links to news articles on upcoming films supporting Asian representation in the Hollywood film industry. You can learn more about these films at the 'More Info' page and support them by going out and watching them. </h3>
